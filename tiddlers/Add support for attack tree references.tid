title: Add support for attack tree references
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

New `twsm_class` 'Attack'.

Same as risk, but derives probability.

Updates become more complicated:

* Find all risks and attack trees which contain sub_tree references.
* How to find dependency graph?
** Javascript filter, use sub_tree references to generate a graph, maintain list to detect circular references.
* [[$:/plugins/security_tools/twsm/defs/twsm_class/attack]]
